lead to serious health problems. This programme will also allow people to manually enter data. It is typical to forget to take medicine. Users will be able to enter their 
medicine name, dose, and hours into this app. When it comes time to take medicine, the app will inform the user. As a result, people will find it impossible to forget about 
their  medication. And they won't be skipping a dose.***
