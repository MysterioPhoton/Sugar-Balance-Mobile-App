Participant #1:
Welcome to my individual practical element. For this I'm using app which is called Sugar Balance. It got quite few features. Most of them are completed except two features which is not completed that are log out and reminder option. So if I press the login button here and don't type anything and just press login it won't allow me to log out because I haven't put anything in it. So let's say my email is this and my password is this which is wrong because as I have tested this app I have already added quite few users to my database. So when I put the login in it it will say yes. It saves me that my login failed because the password is incorrect or the email is incorrect. Now if I put the correct password and logged in it should take me to my home page. As we can see it's saying that login is successful and it took me to my home page. And now if I come back and see there is another option called registration. So if I press on registration and type or fill the form I will be able to sign up as a new user. Let's say it's X, Y and Z and the gender is male, age is like 45, email is@yahoo.com emergency contact, something like this and then the password. I just choose something randomly because my main work is to show that this feature is working. So if now I'll press the sign up button it should allow me to sign up. So let's wait a couple of seconds. As we can see it's taking time. Yes. So now the user have been added to my database and my sign up is successful. If I press okay it will be able to take me to the home page which it took me. So now if I go back and here let's say that all the database where it's going, it's going to my Firebase database which is free by Google and the database I used in my Xamar in my studio is in here in the folder called Firebase data dot H dot Ch which is in my service folder or in Helper. So here you can see that using the URL I have connected my database with my app. So now if I go to my browser, as you can see that's my database, it got quite few tables. First table is the details of the user details. Let's check, let's check the one I have just created. Yes, here we can see the one I have just created have been included in this database. So this is the database which store every data or the tables is needed for my app. Let's go back to my app. So yeah. Now if I log in using my already existed user which is this put my password give it a few moments after pressing the login button, my login is successful. So now let's talk about the home page features here. I have total six features. Among those six features, only five of them are working. Because of the lack of the time, I couldn't get all the work done in my home page. I have a small icon or user image. So if my user feels ill, they don't have to go back or they don't have to go back to their manual and dial the phone number. So if they just press this button called Call NHS feature, they will be directly redirected to the NHS number on their keypad and they will be directly call them. Let's press this button. As we can see, it directly took the user to the keypad with the number in it. They just have to call. So now let's go back to the home page. There is another button which is called Emergency Contact. In our initial registration, when a user put their emergency contact, the app or system will retrieve that number from the database and it will be different for different users for say the ill person don't want to contact NHS, whether they want to contact who is near to them. So they can just press the button, call emergency contact and it will show them their emergency contract already written in their keypad. They just have to dial it and they will be able to talk with them. Let's go back to the home page. Again. Here are more three features, which is called blood pressure, blood sugar and medication. Let's see the medication page. So medication page feature is basically you can add medicines. And as we can see, there are a list of medicine which is already added by the user called Theo. So it will help them to see that when their medicine is and what dose they do need to take and how much they need to take. Because of the lack of time, I couldn't allow to work on the push notification feature. But if I had more time, I would have been able to add the feature called push notification or reminder. So here, let's say I want to add a medicine which is called PEPT and I want to take it in here. It's like ten mg.

I'm just trying to increase the height of this thing so that I can able to show

Participant #1:
now, if I press the submit button,

Participant #1:
this will add that medicine to the list for the user. So if I go back to my database and if I go down, go down, go down to the medication section, I can see see that it has been added to the database and it has been added to the list. It's added by Theo, the medicine name and what time he needs to take and how much dose he needs to take. So let's go back. That's how the medication feature works. So if I go back now, let's talk about the blood sugar. Blood sugar is very vital for a person who needs, who is diabetic type a or B. So this feature will help them to keep track of their potential diabetic. Mark, is their sugar bit more than yesterday or is the sugar is in a good process. That's how they should get to know because in this graph, as you can already see, I have quite put a few inputs in it for Theo. Yesterday it was 3.6 kwh and then on 14 April, as you can see, it was highest and then it was going down. So this graph or trend can help use it to see the changes of their blood sugar or blood pressure after quite a few times. So now if I add the first say today is like 4.3, it will be added in here that his blood pressure is now that in the database and after quite some time, this graph will be updated and he will be able to keep track of it. Let's go back and talk about the blood pressure feature. So blood pressure is like two different types. We know it is systolic and diastolic here. If the user want to see their trend from previous time which is for say they want to see the systolic graph for quite a few days. So if they press the systolic button, as you can see, there's a different graph for his systolic trend which starts from here to there. From graph we can see that it was quite high. It was quite high on 16, it was 170, then it went low on 6th, which was 70. Now he wants to see his diastolic pressure. If he press the diastolic button, as you can see, it shows a trend of his already submitted data in the diastolic cases. So there is quite a bit steady increase in his blood pressure. So he can know that it's not quite good for his health or it is bad for his health so he don't have to worry all the time. If he doesn't feel good, he can always just check the app how his trend is going. And again, if we put his data like today, he's like 78 X 89 so he can just submit it and it will be submitted in our database and when tomorrow he will add his new data, it will be changed. In another sense, the graph will be changed and he will be able to see the potential growth or potential decrease in his blood sugar or blood pressure system. So this app is quite handy and yeah, that's how this apps feature works for the short of time. I couldn't work on the logging about option and remind option. Thank you very much.
